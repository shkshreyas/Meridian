## üî¨ Technical Deep Dive

### Drowsiness Detection Algorithm

```javascript
// Simplified pseudocode of our QINN-based detection
class DrowsinessDetector {
  constructor() {
    this.model = loadQuantumInspiredModel();
    this.kalmanFilter = new KalmanFilter();
    this.history = new CircularBuffer(30); // 30 seconds
  }
  
  async detectDrowsiness(frame) {
    // Extract facial landmarks
    const landmarks = await MediaPipe.detectFace(frame);
    
    // Calculate Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)
    const leftEAR = this.calculateEAR(landmarks.leftEye);
    const rightEAR = this.calculateEAR(landmarks.rightEye);
    const avgEAR = (leftEAR + rightEAR) / 2;
    
    // Temporal smoothing
    const smoothedEAR = this.kalmanFilter.update(avgEAR);
    this.history.push(smoothedEAR);
    
    // QINN inference
    const features = this.extractFeatures(this.history);
    const prediction = await this.model.predict(features);
    
    // Quantum-inspired probability distribution
    const drowsinessScore = this.calculateQuantumProbability(prediction);
    
    return {
      score: drowsinessScore,
      alert: drowsinessScore > 0.7,
      confidence: prediction.confidence
    };
  }
  
  calculateEAR(eyeLandmarks) {
    // Vertical eye distances
    const v1 = distance(eyeLandmarks[1], eyeLandmarks[5]);
    const v2 = distance(eyeLandmarks[2], eyeLandmarks[4]);
    
    // Horizontal eye distance
    const h = distance(eyeLandmarks[0], eyeLandmarks[3]);
    
    return (v1 + v2) / (2.0 * h);
  }
}
```

### Federated Learning Pipeline

Our privacy-preserving ML training happens in 3 phases:

1. **Local Training**: Each device trains on personal data
2. **Gradient Encryption**: Homomorphic encryption of model updates
3. **Secure Aggregation**: Global model update without exposing individual data

```python
# Server-side federated averaging
def federated_averaging(client_models, client_weights):
    global_model = initialize_model()
    
    for layer in global_model.layers:
        weighted_sum = 0
        total_weight = sum(client_weights)
        
        for client_model, weight in zip(client_models, client_weights):
            encrypted_params = client_model.get_encrypted_params(layer)
            weighted_sum += decrypt_and_weight(encrypted_params, weight)
        
        layer.set_params(weighted_sum / total_weight)
    
    return global_model
```
